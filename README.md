## Knowledge

A few things I've learned during this project:

* Loading words from a "txt"-file and add them to an array
* Knowledge about how the dictionary functions works to check if a word is a real word.
* Better knowledge about TableView (reload data etc)


## Acknowledgments

Majority of the knowledge are from the "Hacking with Swift" - course
